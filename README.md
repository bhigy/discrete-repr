# Discrete representations in neural models of spoken language

This code allows to reproduce the results presented in the paper "Discrete representations in neural models of spoken language" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05582).

## Installation

Clone this repo and cd into it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bhigy/discrete-repr.git
cd discrete-repr
```

To create a conda environment with all dependencies, assuming conda has already been installed, run the following:

```sh
conda env create environment.yml
conda activate discrete-repr
```

## Training the models

Instructions to train the models can be found in [docs/VISUALLY_SUPERVISED.md](docs/VISUALLY_SUPERVISED.md) for visually-supervised models and
in [docs/SELF_SUPERVISED.md](docs/SELF_SUPERVISED.md) for self-supervised models.

Alternatively, pretrained models can be obtained from [here](). For the visually-supervised models, simply extract the content of the archive named `experiments.tar.gz` under the root of this repository. For the self-supervised models, follow the instructions for [installation](docs/SELF_SUPERVISED.md#Installation) and extract the archive named `checkpoints.tar.gz` under the root
of the folder `bshall-zerospeech`.

## Evaluation

### Dataset

Our evaluation relies on Flickr8K validation set. If you haven't already done so, follow [the instructions](docs/DATA.md) to download and prepare the data.

### Preparing stimuli for ABX

The phoneme triplets used in the ABX evaluation need to be generated by running:

```bash
python -c "import prepare_flickr8k as F8; F8.prepare_abx(k=1000, overlap=False)"
```

### Extracting activations from the self-supervised models

While the activations from visually-supervised models are extracted automatically during evaluation, extraction of the
activations from the self-supervised models is done in a separate step (for technical reasons). Assuming that the self-supervised model's repository was cloned under the same folder as current repository, this can be done by running:

```bash
cd ../bshall-zerospeech

# Preprocessing data
python preprocess_val.py in_dir=~/corpora/flickr8k dataset=flickr8k/english
python preprocess_val.py in_dir=../discrete-repr/data/flickr8k_abx_wav/ dataset=flickr8k/english_triplets

# Extraction
./vq_analyze.sh

cd ../discrete-repr
```

### Generating results

#### Figures 1 and 2

Figures 1 (correspondence of codes to phonemes according to the 4 metrics) and 2 (recall@10) can be generated by
running `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py
```

#### Figure 3

#### Table 3

Results presented in table 3 (correlation scores) can be generated by running:

```bash
python -c "import main; main.metric_correlation()"
```

#### Table 4

Results presented in table 4 (skew and curtosis) can be generated by running:

```bash
python -c "import main; main.sim_var()"
```
